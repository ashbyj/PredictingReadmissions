# Predicting Readmission in Diabetic Patients
This project is a deep analysis of inpatient admission data of diabetic patients to attempt to predict a readmission.

The dataset used was collected as part of [this paper](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/) and published to [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)

The project is loosely organized according to the [cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) methodology.
